Fetching Records from Knack API:

The script retrieves records from the specified Knack API endpoint (BASE_URL).
It uses a filter to fetch only those records that have a specific status, where the status is determined by the value of field_49 (e.g., records with "N" in field_49).
Local Record Update and CSV Creation:

The script iterates through the fetched records and locally updates a specific field (field_49) to mark the records as processed (changing "N" to "Y").
It creates a Pandas DataFrame for each record using the create_df function, which maps Knack API fields to columns in the DataFrame.
Vendor-Specific CSV Creation:

The script organizes the records into vendor-specific CSV files.
For each vendor, it aggregates the records and creates a Pandas DataFrame (df1).
It saves the vendor-specific DataFrame to a CSV file, with the filename containing the vendor name and a timestamp. The CSV file is saved in multiple locations.
Knack API Record Update:

The script updates the status of each processed record on the Knack platform by making PUT requests to the API endpoint.
The status update involves changing the value of field_49 from "N" to "Y".
Main Execution:

The main function orchestrates the overall process. It calls the functions mentioned above in a logical sequence.
If records are found and processed, it triggers the creation of vendor-specific CSV files.
It provides feedback if no records are found.
Additional Features:

The script uses dynamic filenames for the CSVs, incorporating the vendor name and a timestamp.
Multiple file locations are specified for redundancy in file storage.
Documentation and Readability:

The script is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function and code block.
The README file provides instructions on dependencies, installation, configuration, and usage of the script.
